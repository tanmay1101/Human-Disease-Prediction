# Human-Disease-Prediction
In this Notebook, I will try to explain how we can train a machine learning model using different supervised learning algorithms to get the best model which can accurately classify different human diseases based on provided features like( Joint pain, stomach pain, acidity, itching, rashes, etc.). I will perform the following steps in this article-  Data Loading and Understanding Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering Data Modeling Model Evaluation Model Interpretation We will try to understand how we can implement the below algorithms  Decision Tree classifier MLP Classifier Random Forest Classifier You must be wondering why I have used these algorithms, why not logistic regression or KNN or SVM or others? Don't worry I will try to explain everything in this article.
